Very , Very simple Simulation of routing
My own impplementation of Network addresses : IIP -- IIEST IP

How to run?

-Download ready_made_VM_env
-Import all ova files to a virtual machine
-If your network interfaces are named differently from wlan0 and eth0, rename the network interface of each of the ova files
-run all the virtual systems(nilrouter , nil1.2 , nil1.1 , nil2.1 , nil2.2 ) -- the subscripts are actually the IIPs
- For router:
	> CD CHAT
	> ROUTER

-For other systems
	> CD CHAT
	> CLIENTV2

-Enter IIP according to the subscript of the VM

- Enjoy!
